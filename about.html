 	<p id="aboutme">Thomas Edson once said that the creative process is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration, in my case is 100% inspiration! <br> Hi, my name is Caio Ramon and i love to draw! Currently i study in Fortaleza, Brazil on the System and Digital medias degree on the 3rd semester. I have 19 years on the moment and call myself a developing artist. I worked on a couple projects, one being a game, that you can see on my 'works' tab. For the things that i can do i have some experience on javaScript and basic programing and desing. I specialize on digital art and ,one day, 3d animation wich i plan on developing further on my career. For the drawings that like to do more, just to name a few, are enviroments, characters desing and storybording. <br> I consider life as my canvas and see scenes on a way that others consider futile or not worthy of their attention. A soft summer rain or a wall on a city can be art with you view on the right way. Well, if you wish to know me more you can se my 'contacts' tab and enjoy your visit on my website. See ya!   </p>
